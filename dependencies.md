# Dependencies
LuaLink provides a way to access and use plugins' APIs in your scripts. This feature is very powerful and makes it easy to integrate scripts with other plugins. It must be noted this has not been thoroughly tested yet and some issues may arise. Please be cautious when using this feature.

<br />

### Declaring Dependencies
Before we can start using any external API, we must declare a dependency. This ensures that script will **not be loaded** if dependency plugin is missing. To declare dependencies, you must create `init.lua` file in your script's folder.
```lua /plugins/LuaLink/scripts/example_script/init.lua
return {
    dependencies = {
        "PlaceholderAPI"
    }
}
```
In this example we will use **[PlaceholderAPI](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI)** - a plugin you should already be familiar with.

<br />

### Accessing Dependencies
Next, assuming the plugin is **installed** and **enabled** on the server, any import and call to its API should work as expected.
```lua /plugins/LuaLink/scripts/example_script/main.lua
local PlaceholderAPI = import("me.clip.placeholderapi.PlaceholderAPI")

-- NOTE: Placeholders in this example come from the Server expansion which is not installed by default.
script.logger:info(PlaceholderAPI:setPlaceholders(nil, "Server is running %server_variant% %server_version_full%"))
```
```log Console Output
[00:00:00 INFO]: [LuaLink/example_script] Server is running Paper 1.21.4-224
```
